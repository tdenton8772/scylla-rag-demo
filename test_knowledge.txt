    The Quantum Computing Lab at MIT has three main research areas:
    1. Quantum error correction using surface codes
    2. Topological quantum computing with anyons
    3. Quantum machine learning algorithms
    
    Dr. Sarah Chen leads the quantum error correction team.
    The lab was founded in 2018 and has 15 researchers.
    Their latest paper on quantum supremacy was published in Nature 2024.
